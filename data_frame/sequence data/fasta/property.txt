The description line begins with a greater than symbol (>) and contains the sequence identifier and other (optional) information. The sequence data begins on the next line after the description, and continues until thereâ€™s another description line (a line beginning with >) or the file ends. 

A common naming convention is to split the description line into two parts at the first space: the identifier and the comment, like >gene_00284728 length=231;type=dna
