pigment molecules are part of a core complex around the reaction center. Others form light-harvesting complexes (LHCs) around the periphery of the core complex.
each monomer of the trimeric light-harvesting complex LHCII contains seven molecules of chlorophyll a, five of chlorophyll b, and two of lutein.
