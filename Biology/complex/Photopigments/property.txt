Chlorophylls a and b and bacteriochlorophyll are the primary gatherers of light energy
Phycoerythrobilin and phycocyanobilin (phycobilins) are the antenna pigments in cyanobacteria and red algae
Î²-Carotene (a carotenoid) and lutein (a xanthophyll) are accessory pigments in plants
The conjugated bond systems (alternating single and double bonds) in these molecules largely account for the absorption of visible light.
