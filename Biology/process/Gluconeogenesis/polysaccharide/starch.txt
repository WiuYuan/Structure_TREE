Starch : high molecular weight polymer of D-glucose in (α1→4) linkage. 
synthesized in chloroplasts for temporary storage
synthesized in amyloplasts for long-term storage
ADP- glucose
amylose of starch is unbranched
amylopectin has numerous (α1→6)-linked branches
Chloroplasts contain a branching enzyme, similar to glycogen-branching enzyme
